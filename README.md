## 🔗 Project Resources

A complete archive of **I.G.N.I.T.E** – our AI-powered disaster response system – including:

- 🔥 Trained AI models:
  - `fire_detection_best.onnx` – YOLOv8 model for real-time fire detection
  - `fire_classification_best.onnx` – CNN model for classifying fire severity (low, medium, high)
  - `human_detection_best.pt` – YOLOv8 model for detecting trapped victims
- 🧪 Custom datasets used for training (fire, severity, victim)
- 📽️ Simulation clips from Gazebo and RViz demonstrating robot performance
- 📚 Research papers and academic references used to guide development
- 🧠 Full AI pipeline documentation, architecture decisions, and deployment notes
